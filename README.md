## About

This is a Scientific Calculator made with Python Tkinter with voice over feature that helps even blind people to use it. As soon as you hover over a button its says the number of the button instead of clicking the button the saying the number and helps them more. This is my first Tkinter GUI calculator as a part of a Competion.

## Key Features

* Voice Over
* Various Themes.

## Planed Updates

* Use of keyboard instead of mouse.

## Installation

Other than Tkinter this program requires only pyttsx3 library for voice over.

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```
